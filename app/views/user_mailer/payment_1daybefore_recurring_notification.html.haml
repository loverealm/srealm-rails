%p Dear #{@user.full_name(false)},

- if @payment.goal == 'pledge'
  %p Your #{@payment.goal} of #{number_to_currency(@payment.amount)} to #{@payment.payable.try(:name)} is due tomorrow. Malachi 3:10 says: “Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,” says the LORD Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it.”
- else 
  %p Your partner payment of #{number_to_currency(@payment.amount)} to #{@payment.payable.try(:name)} is due tomorrow. Proverbs 11:25 says that A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.

  God Richly Bless you,
